# Ft Printf
The aim of this project was to do a simplified version of printf, which only works with "c, s, d, p, i, x, X, %" conversions.
Despite having a setup that could be used to solve the bonus I did not do it.

The bonus required the implementation of flags, which could be done using a structure to count the flags that would be applied.
